During my second year studying Energy Engineering, for the module "Zero Emission and Positive Energy Districts", I performed an energy strategy report, designing district energy needs, HVAC, renewable energy integration, optimisation, LCA and climate change resilience considering 2050 predicted data. Simulations were run using MATLAB, for a case study in Milan, “Green Between – Tessiture Urbane”.
